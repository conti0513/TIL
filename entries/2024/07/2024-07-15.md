The provided file content and instructions do not contain any direct credentials. However, it is important to ensure that no sensitive information is included inadvertently. Here's a quick check:

1. **Environment Variables and Secrets**:
   - The GitHub Actions workflow uses secrets for `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, which are securely stored in GitHub's secrets management.

2. **Docker Commands**:
   - The `docker login` command is used, but it does not expose any credentials directly. It prompts for login credentials or uses previously stored credentials.

3. **No Hard-Coded Credentials**:
   - There are no hard-coded usernames, passwords, API keys, or tokens in the provided content.

### Safe Example

### Docker Hub Image Build and Push

1. **Move to Project Directory**

    ```sh
    cd /workspaces/development_public
    ```

2. **Edit `app.py`**

    ```sh
    vim /workspaces/development_public/infra_pjt/python_project/app.py
    ```

    Edit the content in Vim as follows:

    ```python
    print("Hello, Python and Docker")
    ```

    After making the changes, press `Esc` to return to command mode, type `:wq`, and press Enter to save the file and exit Vim.

3. **Stage the Changes**

    ```sh
    git add /workspaces/development_public/infra_pjt/python_project/app.py
    ```

4. **Ignore Changes in Submodule**

    ```sh
    git reset TIL
    ```

5. **Commit the Changes**

    ```sh
    git commit -m "Update hello message in app.py"
    ```

6. **Push the Changes**

    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```

7. **Verify GitHub Actions Execution**

    Go to the GitHub Actions page and verify that the workflow is triggered and the build and push are successful.

    - Navigate to the GitHub repository
    - Click on the "Actions" tab
    - Verify the latest workflow run

8. **Pull and Run the Docker Image**

    ```sh
    docker login && docker pull --platform linux/amd64 your-dockerhub-username/python-project:latest && docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 your-dockerhub-username/python-project:latest
    ```

    Ensure that the new message "Hello, Python and Docker" is displayed.

### Risk Management in Public Repository

#### 1. Set Up Secrets

1. **Navigate to the GitHub Repository**
2. **Select "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"**
3. **Click "New repository secret"**
4. Add the following secrets:
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password

#### 2. Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create the `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-push-python:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: ./infra_pjt/python_project
          push: true
          tags: your-dockerhub-username/python-project:latest
```

#### 3. Push the Code

1. **Stage the Changes**

    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

2. **Ignore Changes in Submodule**

    ```sh
    git reset TIL
    ```

3. **Commit the Changes**

    ```sh
    git commit -m "Set up Docker build for Python project"
    ```

4. **Push the Changes**

    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```

---

### Security Measures

1. **Regularly Update Secrets**
   - Regularly update secrets such as passwords and API keys.

2. **Monitor Audit Logs**
   - Use GitHub's audit log feature to check for any unusual activities.

3. **Respond to Security Alerts**
   - Utilize GitHub's security alerts feature to quickly address any vulnerabilities found.

---

### Summary

By following these steps, you can minimize risks in public repositories and securely manage secrets.

### Download and Run Docker Image Locally

1. **Install Docker**

    Ensure that Docker is installed on your local machine. If not, follow the installation instructions from the link below:

    - [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

2. **Download the Docker Image**

    ```sh
    docker pull your-dockerhub-username/python-project:latest
    ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**

    ```sh
    docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 your-dockerhub-username/python-project:latest
    ```

    To execute in one line:

    ```sh
    docker login && docker pull --platform linux/amd64 your-dockerhub-username/python-project:latest && docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 your-dockerhub-username/python-project:latest
    ```

This will allow you to develop using the Docker image on your local environment as well.

---

### Troubleshooting

1. **GitHub Actions Configuration**
   - Correct the Docker Hub repository name in `docker-publish.yml`.
   - Ensure the secrets are set correctly. Correction point: USERNAME

2. **Staging and Committing Changes**
   - Ensure the changes in `app.py` are staged and committed to the remote repository. `app.py` was not committed and pushed initially.

3. **Pulling and Running the Docker Image**
   - Use the `--platform linux/amd64` option to pull and run the Docker image. This option is necessary to pull the image correctly.
